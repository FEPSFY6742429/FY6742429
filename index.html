      Water is essential for human survival, and its quality is crucial for people’s health and well-being.
      Among the many different contaminants that can affect water quality, heavy metals pose some of the greatest risks.
      These metals, including lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, and chromium, can enter drinking water sources through
      industrial discharge of chemicals, agricultural runoff, and the corrosion of pipes. If not properly removed,
      they can lead to serious health problems. This article explores how heavy metals are removed from drinking water
      and why this process is vital for public health.

           Heavy metals are naturally occurring elements with high atomic weights and densities
           that can be toxic to humans even in small concentrations. These metals tend to build up
           in the body over time, leading to potential poisoning. Lead is particularly harmful to 
           children and can cause developmental delays, learning difficulties, and behavioural problems.
           Arsenic is linked to skin, lung, and bladder cancer, while cadmium exposure can lead to
           kidney damage and bone loss (ATSDR, 2019). Given these severe health risks, the removal of
           heavy metals from drinking water is crucial.

           The presence of heavy metals in drinking water can happen from various sources. Industrial
           activities such as mining and manufacturing, agricultural practices involving pesticides 
           and fertilizers, and the aging infrastructure of water supply systems, where old pipes leach
           metals like lead, are all contributors (Kümmerer et al., 2017). Water treatment systems must be
           equipped to remove or reduce these harmful substances.
