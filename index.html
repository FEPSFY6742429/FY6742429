           Removing heavy metals from drinking water is a crucial process to ensure public health and safety. Heavy metals
           such as lead, arsenic, mercury, cadmium and chromium can get into our drinking water by industrial discharge of 
           chemicals, agricultural runoff and the deterioration of water systems. These metals are bad in the water supply 
           as they are toxic even at low concentrations and can cause serios health risks, including developmental issues in
           children, organ damage and cancer. Many methods are used to remove heavy metals from drinking water, such as activated 
           carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, ion exchange, coagulation and flocculation and bioremediation. These methods are 
           often used in combination with each for a more effective treatment. Overall removing heavy metals from drinking water 
           is key to providing clean and safe water and reducing long term health risks for vulnerable people.

           Water is essential for human survival, and its quality is crucial for people’s health and well-being.
           Among the many different contaminants that can affect water quality, heavy metals pose some of the greatest risks.
           These metals, including lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, and chromium, can enter drinking water sources through
           industrial discharge of chemicals, agricultural runoff, and the corrosion of pipes. If not properly removed,
           they can lead to serious health problems. This article explores how heavy metals are removed from drinking water
           and why this process is vital for public health.

           Heavy metals are naturally occurring elements with high atomic weights and densities
           that can be toxic to humans even in small concentrations. These metals tend to build up
           in the body over time, leading to potential poisoning. Lead is particularly harmful to 
           children and can cause developmental delays, learning difficulties, and behavioural problems.
           Arsenic is linked to skin, lung, and bladder cancer, while cadmium exposure can lead to
           kidney damage and bone loss (ATSDR, 2019). Given these severe health risks, the removal of
           heavy metals from drinking water is crucial.

           The presence of heavy metals in drinking water can happen from various sources. Industrial
           activities such as mining and manufacturing, agricultural practices involving pesticides 
           and fertilizers, and the aging infrastructure of water supply systems, where old pipes leach
           metals like lead, are all contributors (Kümmerer et al., 2017). Water treatment systems must be
           equipped to remove or reduce these harmful substances.

           Activated Carbon Filtration

           Activated carbon, also known as activated charcoal, is widely used in water purification systems.
           It works through adsorption, where contaminants adhere to the surface of the carbon granules. This
           method is effective for removing metals like lead and mercury. Activated carbon filters are often used
           in household water purifiers and are found to be highly efficient in reducing the concentration of heavy
           metals when used alongside other methods like reverse osmosis (López et al., 2021).

           Reverse Osmosis

           Reverse osmosis (RO) is a water treatment process that forces water through a semi-permeable membrane,
           which allows only water molecules to pass through while blocking larger particles, including heavy metals.
           RO is one of the most effective techniques for removing a wide range of contaminants, including lead, arsenic,
           and chromium (Okuno et al., 2020). The high efficiency of reverse osmosis makes it suitable for both residential
           and municipal water systems.

           Ion Exchange

           Ion exchange is a chemical process in which ions of heavy metals in water are replaced by less harmful ions, such as
           sodium or potassium. This method is especially useful for removing metal ions like calcium and heavy metals such as cadmium
           and lead. Water treatment plants often use ion exchange with other methods to ensure the complete removal of toxic metals
           (Chong et al., 2019).

           Coagulation and Flocculation

           Coagulation and flocculation are chemical processes that involve the addition of coagulants to water, causing particles to clump
           together and form larger aggregates known as flocs. These flocs can then be removed through sedimentation or filtration.
           This method is effective for removing particulate forms of heavy metals, such as arsenic and lead, which may be bound to suspended particles in the
           water (Sivaneswaran et al., 2017).

           Bioremediation

           Bioremediation is an emerging method in which microorganisms are used to detoxify heavy metals in water. These organisms, such as bacteria 
           and fungi, can absorb or transform heavy metals into less toxic forms. While still in the research phase for large-scale applications,
           bioremediation has shown promise as an environmentally friendly and sustainable alternative to traditional chemical-based methods 
           (Parihar et al., 2021).

        Health Protection

        Heavy metals can cause a range of health issues, from poisoning to long-term chronic conditions. The World Health Organization
        (WHO) has set guidelines for the maximum allowable concentrations of various metals in drinking water to protect human health.
        For instance, the permissible level of lead in drinking water is 0.01 mg/L, and for arsenic, it is 0.01 mg/L (WHO, 2017). Ensuring 
        that these metals are removed from drinking water reduces the risk of exposure and prevents the harmful effects they can have on the body.

        Protecting Vulnerable Populations

        Children, pregnant women, the elderly, and individuals with weak immune systems are particularly vulnerable to the effects of heavy metals. 
        Exposure to even low levels of lead can result in development issues in children. By ensuring that drinking water is free from harmful metals,
        we can protect these vulnerable populations from the long-term health consequences of exposure.

        Environmental Benefits

        Heavy metals can also have detrimental effects on the environment, contaminating aquatic ecosystems and soil. For example, high levels of mercury and
        arsenic in water bodies can harm aquatic life, disrupting the food chain and ecosystem balance. By removing heavy metals from drinking water, we not 
        only protect human health but also help the preservation of the environment and biodiversity.

        Compliance with Regulations

        Many countries have established strict water quality standards to ensure the safety of drinking water. Compliance with these regulations is essential 
        for public health and safety. By using effective water treatment methods to remove heavy metals, water treatment facilities can ensure that they meet 
        these standards, avoiding legal and financial penalties.

         <pre>
          The removal of heavy metals from drinking water is a crucial step in safeguarding public health, protecting vulnerable populations, and preserving the
           environment. With a variety of removal methods available, such as activated carbon filtration, reverse osmosis and ion exchange, water treatment systems
           can efficiently address the contamination of drinking water. Given the significant health risks associated with heavy metal exposure, investing in advanced
           water purification technology is vital to ensure clean and safe drinking water for everyone.
